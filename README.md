Core promoter detection with DNABERT-2 uses a pre-trained model on genomic data to identify promoter regions, employing Byte Pair Encoding for efficient DNA tokenization. This method enhances accuracy and computational performance in promoter prediction tasks. The core promoter itself is a crucial regulatory DNA sequence at the transcription start site, supporting the assembly of transcription machinery and initiation by RNA polymerase. It plays a pivotal role in gene expression, influencing transcriptional programs during development and differentiation.
